<p>Hello! And welcome to my blog.</p>
<p>My goal is to write my blog in a way that someone with only very basic computer skills can understand. You don’t need to have a prior knowledge of machine learning, networking, security, or programming. To be perfectly honest, I’m writing this blog for the one person who I know will read it – <em>my Mom.</em></p>
<p>For those who do have a more technical background, please see the references listed in the footnotes.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s get started. For my senior project, I am participating the Kaggle competition:</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Malware Prediction - Can you predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware?</strong> (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction" class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction</a>)</p>
<p>My goal is to ultimately complete this competition in both R Studio and Python.</p>
<p>We’ll begin by taking a look at the description of the competition provided on Kaggle. Below each paragraph I’ll break down what it’s talking about and define key terms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The goal of this competition is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft’s endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great, lets break this down a bit. We want to know how likely is it that a machine (laptop, desktop, virtual image) will be hit with malware. Malware is simply defined by Wikipedia as “any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer.” You can read more in-depth about it here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware</a>. (Yes, I know it’s a Wikipedia reference, but it does a great job of giving the malware-basics).</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to track, detect, defend against, and learn about malware but in this case, we are using information from a service provided my Microsoft called Windows Defender.</p>
<p>Windows Defender is an endpoint protection solution, meaning that it is located where your network touches the outside world.</p>
<p>You can think of a network like a home. Inside your home, you are typically safe. There are walls to protect you and you have a space to live. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to live well without sometimes leaving your home. You have to go to work to earn money, get food from the grocery store, and socialize with others. When you leave your home, you are exposed to threats. These could be contagious diseases, dangerous people, accidents, or who knows what else. To protect against these threats, you take precautions. You lock your doors and windows so people cannot get in, you wash your hands, you follow the traffic rules, and you do many other things to keep you and your home safe.</p>
<p>In the world of computers, your home is called your “network”. It can be comprised of various forms of hardware and software. The world outside your home is simply referred to as “threats”. This can be viruses, bugs, hackers, spam, and the list goes on.
Windows Defender is the protection you put between your network and outside threats. It is like locking your windows and doors and having a security camera in place to record suspicious activity.</p>
<p>Just like you would pull security camera footage to see what has been happening around your house, Windows Defender provides heartbeat and threat reports.</p>
<p>That wraps up this first post! Thanks for reading! In my next post I’ll dive into what heartbeat and threat reports are.</p>
