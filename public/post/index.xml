      <description>Hello! And welcome to my blog.
My goal is to write my blog in a way that someone with only very basic computer skills can understand. You don’t need to have a prior knowledge of machine learning, networking, security, or programming. To be perfectly honest, I’m writing this blog for the one person who I know will read it – my Mom.
For those who do have a more technical background, please see the references listed in the footnotes.</description>

      <description>Hello again! And welcome to my second post. If you missed the first one, you can read it here.

A heartbeat is a packet of data sent from the agent to the management server on a regular basis, by default every 60 seconds, using port 5723 (UDP).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the final part of our project scope! If you missed the first two, you can read part 1 here and part 2 here.
Last time we discussed some of the differences between supervised and unsupervised algorithms. In this competition I’ll most likely be using supervised algorithms.
The data will be broken into two main sections: train and test (I will also be using a validation set but we won’t dive into that here).</description>
